Work for the Subject
--------------------

_Writing_

You will be writing four essays for the class, which should total between 20-25 pp. At least the first of these must be revised, including not only proof-reading but substantive rethinking, and will be regraded; revisions of later essays are allowed but not required.

Do talk about the reading and your writing as much as you wish with classmates and friends, but be sure you credit their ideas in the finished paper; collaboration is excellent. I don't encourage use of secondary sources for this subject; if you do use them, you must acknowledge your sources in a footnote, even if you do not quote them word for word. Using secondary sources is not required; if used, they must be acknowledged and properly cited. **This includes internet sources!** (You can refer to a [useful guide to evaluating on-line sources](http://www.virtualsalt.com/evalu8it.htm).) Writing is almost always a collaborative process at some level, but failure to respect the intellectual property of others counts as plagiarism. Plagiarism — use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement — is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarise will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution see me, or consult the style guides available in the Writing and Communication Center and the [MIT Website on Plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/).

_Participation_

Your regular attendance and engagement with class discussion counts towards this part of the work for the subject. Unexcused absences will be reflected in your grade. You can also expect to lead at least one discussion on the reading; particulars will depend on the size of the class.
